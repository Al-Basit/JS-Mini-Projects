# JavaScript Beginner Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Beginner Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of small projects that I created during my learning process. Each project helped me grasp different concepts and improve my skills as a JavaScript developer. Feel free to explore and use these projects as a learning resource or as a starting point for your own projects.
